	In this study, we will experimentally measure frequency response of simple low-pass filter using oscilloscope technique. Used low-pass filter consists of resistor and capacitor. 
	
	The study is inspired by study materials provided by the Department of Experimental Physics FMFI UK.\cite{praktikaElmag}
